# Praline's Arena
Gameproject in Keimyung university


# Context
This project was developped by a team of 5 EPITECH students, during one semester in the university of Keimyung in South Korea.


# What is it ?
Praline's Arena is a battle royale game in which you incarnate a soldier, going to fight to marry the princess Praline. The particularity of the map is the presence of 3 nested walls between the different zones. 

To cross the walls, the players have to find the entry gates, and solve some enigmas. The players are pushed to the center by a force field that deal damages to the players if they go into it. 

As in all battle royale games, the goal is to be the last one alive.

Here is a little [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLG2IwoZlsM&t=18s) showing some gameplay.

# I want to play
To enjoy the game you can download the latest release available in this repository. With this executable, you will be only able to play in local, without multiplayer (it's quite useless for a battle royal, but you will win for sure).

So, to have fun with your friends, you can download the server here [Marc-Antoine-Leconte/PralineServer](https://github.com/Marc-Antoine-Leconte/PralineServer).
